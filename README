  I. About

    This repository provides example content for puppet-boilerplate-modules [1].
    It should give you an impression of what to expect from and how to use
    puppet-boilerplate-modules and if the project might be useful for you.

  II. Usage

    There are different "example-module-[name]" directories. Each folder
    contains:

    1. An example module which was created with the help of
       puppet-boilerplate-modules.

    2. A doc directory which contains the output of "puppet doc --mode rdoc".

    3. A README file which explains what was necessary to create the example
       content.

    cool QR Code merchandise [2]. Thank you! :-)
