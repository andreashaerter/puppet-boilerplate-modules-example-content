  I. About

    This repository provides example content for puppet-boilerplate-modules [1].
    It should give you an impression of what to expect from and how to use
    puppet-boilerplate-modules and if the project might be useful for you.

  II. Usage

    There are different "example-module-[name]" directories. Just have a look
    at them. Each folder contains:

    1. An example module which was created with the help of
       puppet-boilerplate-modules. This should give you an impression of the
       Puppet source quality and how the created modules will look like.

    2. A "doc" directory which contains the output of "puppet doc --mode rdoc".
       Please note that you can't browse the rendered documentation on GitHub
       (because it just shows you the source). But you may clone this repository
       and open the "index.html" of the documentation you want to look at.

    3. A README file which explains what was necessary to create the example
       content. The creation transcripts should be useful to learn how to use
       the puppet-boilerplate-modules project.



  III. Other notes
