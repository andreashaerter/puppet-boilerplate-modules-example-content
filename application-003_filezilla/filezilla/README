== module: filezilla

Manages FileZilla, a feature-rich, cross-platform Open Source file transfer
client. It comes with support for FTP, SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and
FTP over SSL/TLS (FTPS).

This module does not manage FileZilla _server_ (which is a FTP server for
windows by the same developers).

Have a look at the main module class (<tt>init.pp</tt>) to see what this
module does on a node plus usage examples.

==== Security note

Like many other applications, <b>FileZilla stores all handled login data and
credentials as plain text files</b>. Have a look at the following directory:
* <tt>~/.filezilla/</tt> on Unix-like systems.
* <tt>%AppData%\FileZilla\\</tt> on MS Windows (<tt>%AppData%</tt> is a Windows
  environment variable, pointing to the current application data dir of your
  account. Try to access <tt>%AppData%\FileZilla\\</tt> directly via Windows
  Explorer and you'll see how it works).
You will find <tt>recentservers.xml</tt> and <tt>sitemanager.xml</tt> there
after using the program to log into a system. This is expected behavior because
it is your operating system's responsibility too keep these files save. But
keep it in mind if you are using a non-encrypted and/or multi-user systems.
